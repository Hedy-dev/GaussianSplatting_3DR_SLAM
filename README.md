# GaussianSplatting_3DR_SLAM
This repository contains implementations of Gaussian Splatting for 3D reconstruction and SLAM. It provides the necessary code to deploy these techniques for generating detailed 3D maps and performing efficient and accurate localization and mapping in dynamic environments.
